IF USING BIGCOMMERCE:

This is a mega menu that integrates with BigCommerce templates that do no already have mega menus.  This code references one of the BC code snippets and autogenerated a mega menu from the categories that are created in the BC control panel.  I have included instructions in the index.html file.

IF NOT USING BIGCOMMERCE:

You can also use this code but you'll have to input the links manually or write you own code to generate it automatically.


If you have any questions or suggestion please let me know.
